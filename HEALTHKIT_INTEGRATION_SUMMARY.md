# HealthKit Integration Summary

## What has been implemented:

### HealthKitManager Enhancements:
- ✅ Added support for distance (walking/running) data
- ✅ Added support for active calories burned data  
- ✅ Added real-time observers for all health metrics
- ✅ Enhanced permission requests for steps, distance, and calories
- ✅ Improved error handling and debugging logs
- ✅ Added methods to fetch historical data for date ranges

### DataManager Updates:
- ✅ Created new `DailyHealthData` structure to store steps, distance, and calories
- ✅ Updated `WeeklyInsight` and `MonthlyInsight` to include distance and calories
- ✅ Modified data fetching to combine all health metrics from HealthKit
- ✅ Real-time updates when health data changes

### UI Updates:
- ✅ **DataInsightsView**: Now shows real distance and calories cards, plus updated PersonalRecordsView with real data
- ✅ **HomeView**: Uses real health data and properly updates DataManager
- ✅ **ProfileView**: Added distance and calories cards showing real-time data
- ✅ **LeaderboardView**: Already uses real data for current user

### Data Flow:
1. HealthKitManager requests permissions for steps, distance, and calories
2. Real-time observers watch for data changes
3. DataManager combines all metrics into unified daily records
4. All views display real HealthKit data instead of mock data

## To Test:

1. **Grant HealthKit Permissions**: When prompted, allow access to steps, distance, and calories
2. **Verify Data Display**: Check that real data shows up in:
   - Home screen (current steps)
   - Profile view (steps, distance, calories)
   - Data Insights (comprehensive analytics)
3. **Test Real-time Updates**: Walk around and verify step count updates automatically
4. **Check Historical Data**: Verify weekly/monthly insights show real historical data

## Debugging:
- Check console logs for `🏥` prefixed messages to see HealthKit status
- Use `healthKitManager.checkAllPermissions()` to verify permission status
- Fallback data is automatically provided if HealthKit is unavailable

## Requirements:
- iOS device with HealthKit capability
- Health app with some existing data (or generate by walking)
- Proper permissions granted in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Health
